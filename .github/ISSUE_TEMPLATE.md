## Expected behavior

<!--
  Describe the intended output or what you expected to see.
-->

## Steps to reproduce the behavior

  Include a link to a public repository or ZIP file so that the behavior or bug
  can easily be reproduced. Being able to see your actual files helps with
  troubleshooting as most issues stem from invalid/missing YAML Front Matter, a
  miss-configured _config.sys file, or problematic site content.

  Describe the steps you took for this problem to exist. Such as: you cloned the
  theme, customized _config.yml, added your own posts, and started up a Jekyll
  server locally

  If an error occurred on GitHub Pages when pushing, please test a local version
  following these setup instructions: 
  https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/

  Then provide a complete log by running `bundle exec jekyll build --trace --verbose`
  and include this output in the filed issue.

  Screenshots can also be included if they help illustrate a behavior.
